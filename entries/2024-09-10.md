# Underscores and private methods

#TIL That prefixing your method names with an `_` was a way to indicate the method is a private method. This is however an outdated convention.

# Killing ports on Mac

This is something that __no matter__ how many times I need to do it, I always find myself Googling and each time I feel silly for doing so.

```
lsof -i tcp:<port_numer>
```

```
kill -9 <port_numer>
```

# Handling conflicts | Theirs vs Ours

Came across this while re-listening to [The Laracasts Snippet](https://laracasts.com/podcast) with [Jeffery Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way). The
concept of "their" vs "ours" when dealing with merge conflicts, is something I __always__ get backwards too. I never learn my lesson when it comes to
this situation.
