# Finding repeat occurrences in MySQL
Found myself diagnosing an issue today and my debugging journey led me to needing to determine how many records in a table shared the same value for a specific column. Figured this was something I could pretty easily find out with a well written query. After a little bit of tinkering, here is the gist of that query. 
```sql
SELECT <target_column>,
       count(*) AS times_used,
FROM <target_table>
GROUP BY <target_column>
HAVING times_used > 1
ORDER BY times_used DESC;
```
This would ultimately give me something that resembled the following

| target_column | times_used |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 123.png       | 40         |
| abc.png       | 30         |
| xyz.jpg       | 20         |
