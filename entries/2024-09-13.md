# Implemented a `hasManyThrough` relationship

I don't often get to reach for the [`hasManyThrough`](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent-relationships#has-many-through) so whenever I am able to
pull this little trick out of the old dev hat, it feels good. I'll be real though and admit, it takes me a moment or two to figure out which keys I
need to add where within the method call..
