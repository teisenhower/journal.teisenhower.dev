# GraphQL with Laravel | Lighthouse
GraphQL simply replaces your typical restful api endpoints 
#### Edges and Nodes
GraphQL uses this concept "Edges" and "Nodes". This relates to Graph theory. Think of edges and nodes as the different fields to Collections or Arrays. 

> I don't yet understand when you need to add `edge` and `node` in your query 
#### Directives
Directives in Lighthouse map to Laravel functionality. For example, the `@all` directive will map to something like `User::all()` in Eloquent. 
#### GraphQL Playground
Unable to get the playground area working for WCV, I know I had this before using the GraphQL Playground Electron app.
#### Thoughts
Overall after going through the first few videos of the [Laracast series](https://laracasts.com/series/graphql-with-laravel-and-vue) and looking at the WCV codebase more, I am starting to getting a better handle on how this works. At least at an entry level. 
# Caiden's npm error
The error he is receiving is `CERT_HAS_EXPIRED`

One of the packages was resolving this registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org which did not have a valid SSL cert. Not sure why or how this happened honestly.
> `https://registry.npm.taobao.org/which-module/download/which-module-2.0.0.tgz`

But I found this [Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64792062) of someone who had the same exact issue

It also turned out later that he was using node v20 and the project should have been run using node v14. That project had a `.nvmrc` file that allowed us to quickly determine that. 
#### Tried
- `npm cache clean --force`
- `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`
