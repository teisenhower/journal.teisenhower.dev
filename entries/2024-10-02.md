# Using scopes with eager loading
Had a situation today where I needed to eager load a relationship **but** I wanted also wanted utilize a local scope that was defined on the related model I was trying to eager load. Thankfully it turns out this was super easy to add by [constraining the eager load](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent-relationships#constraining-eager-loads).

When using the `with` method, we just pass the method an array where the `key` is the name of the relationship we want to eager load and the `value` is a closure where we can define our constraints. These constrains can include scopes that are defined on the related model!

Here is a basic example where we want to get our Shipping records and eager load the related Order but only if it is fulfilled. 

```php
Shipping::with([
	"order" => function ($query) {
		$query->fulfilled();
	}
])->get();
```

We can do the same when using `withWhereHas`. The syntax for this is a little different however. Instead of passing in an array, we instead pass 2, the relationship we want to eager load and a callback where we can again just define our constraints.

In this example we only want to get Shipping records where their related Order record has a status of fulfilled and also eager load that Order. 

```php
Shipping::withWhereHas("order", function ($query) {
	$query->fulfilled();
})->get();
```
