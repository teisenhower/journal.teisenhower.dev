# The `laravel_through_key`
There `laravel_through_key` is something I've recently stumbled across with all of this new Eloquent work I have been doing and would like to dive deeper into. So far I have found that it has to do with the `HasManyThrough` relationship

# MySQL `UNION` and `UNION ALL`
Update on my feature struggles from yesterday. The current solution I am going with is to utilize 
[Laravel Unions](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/queries#unions) in order to grab all of my data from the different tables into a single query, allowing me to filter them, order them and apply pagination.  Due to the nature of the data I need to pull, I needed to opt for using `UNION ALL` since I need to preserve duplicates. 

Unfortunately I don't think I can openly share **all** of the code but here is a super vague overview of what is happening.
```php
$groupMemberPayments = GroupMemberPayment::select(["<target_columns>"])  
    ->join("<target_join_tables>")
    ->distinct()  
    ->where();  

$payments = Payment::select(["<target_columns>"])  
    ->join("<target_join_tables>")  
    ->where("<where_conditions>")  
    ->with("<target_eager_load_relationships>")  
    ->unionAll($groupMemberPayments)  
    ->orderBy("timestamp", "DESC")  
    ->get();
```
