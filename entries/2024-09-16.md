# Finally made use of Laravel's `withWhereHas` method
We're on a stretch here recently of using Eloquent methods I don't often get to. In this case, this was my first time reaching for the [`withWhereHas`](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent-relationships#constraining-eager-loads-with-relationship-existence) method. The story goes, I needed to find Group Member Payments but _only_ those that had a specific Payment type. The model relationship here is a Payment is made up of many Group Member Payments and `payment_type` lives on the Payment model. 

```php
GroupMemberPayment::withWhereHas("payment", function ($query) {
	$query->where("payment_type", Payment::TYPE_TRANSFER);
})->get();
```

It was kind of amazing to see how easy this method make it to retrieve only models where their related data meets a specific condition.
